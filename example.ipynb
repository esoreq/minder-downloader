    "# Minder Downloader\n",
    "The minder-downloader module is a Python package that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Minder research portal.  \n",
    "This package enables users to easily download datasets from the Minder research portal, as well as upload reports to the platform.\n",
    "The downloading functionality of the package is straightforward to use.  \n",
    "The module handles the authentication and request/response handling, so the user doesn't need to worry about the details of these processes.  \n",
    "Once authenticated, users can specify the date range and datasets to download, and the module will return the data as a Pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "This makes it easy to work with the data using Python's powerful data analysis tools.  \n",
    "This is a complementary tool to dcarte that is intended to simplify the creation of period-specific models or dashboards that communicate data for a short period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to downloading data, the minder-downloader module also provides a simple way to upload reports to the Minder research portal. \n",
    "This can be done by providing the path to a file and the HTML address to upload the file.  \n",
    "The module takes care of the uploading process, making sharing reports with collaborators or the wider research community easy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the minder-downloader package provides a convenient and streamlined way to interact with the Minder research portal, whether you need to download data or upload reports.\n"

    "### Import \n",
    "When working on tasks that involve downloading files or data from online sources, it can be incredibly helpful to import a Python package known as \"minder_downloader\" and assign it the convenient and easily-remembered acronym \"md\", as this allows for streamlined and efficient coding and can save precious time and effort in the long run."

    "### Review available datasets\n",
    "One of the key advantages of using the \"minder_downloader\" package for data downloading is the ability to easily review and access available datasets through the convenient `md.datasets()` function. By calling this function, users can quickly connect to the minder research platform and retrieve a comprehensive list of datasets that are currently being maintained on the portal. This can be particularly beneficial for researchers, data scientists, and other professionals who need to access large amounts of data for their work, as it allows them to quickly and easily identify relevant datasets and begin analyzing them right away. Additionally, the \"minder_downloader\" package is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it accessible to even those who may not have extensive experience with coding or data analysis. Whether you are working on a research project, developing new software, or simply seeking to expand your knowledge of a particular field, the \"minder_downloader\" package can be an invaluable tool for streamlining your workflow and maximising your productivity."

    "When it comes to data analysis and research, having access to a wide variety of data sources is critical. The minder platform is specifically designed to provide users with access to a broad range of datasets from different organizations. The platform supports several different cohorts, which are groups of individuals who share certain characteristics or traits. These cohorts can include anything from patients with a specific medical condition to people living in a specific geographical location. By reviewing the available cohorts, users can decide which cohorts to download data for and how to analyze it.\n",

This function allows users to easily connect to the minder research platform and retrieve the most up-to-date list of organizations and cohorts that currently exist. By examining this list, users can quickly identify relevant cohorts and begin accessing the associated datasets for their analysis. Additionally, the minder platform is constantly expanding, with new organizations and cohorts being added regularly. This means that users can expect to have access to an ever-growing pool of data sources, ensuring that they always have the latest and most comprehensive data available for their research needs."

The package provides a simple and efficient way to download individual datasets or batches of datasets using just a few lines of code. Users can also use the package to download and combine multiple datasets into a single file for easier analysis."
